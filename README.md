# NetSim
A Network Simulation building tool.  Just download the full code and run it.  Add your own functions, easily, to interact with the data.
The code shown here lists: 
How the classes are initially crated for, nodes, Lans and Packets
The setup code that controls all the settings and inputs for a simulation to run.
The actual simulator main code that uses the above parts needs to be downloaded from zaipaul.com
Or email zaipaul@yahoo.com stating what you will use the simulation code for.
.
This code allows any person, new to simulation building, to use and then adapt an internet type network simulator.
The more complex aditions to the code, does require a good understanding of coding in Python,
but anyone can add some code to control, analysis and view packets as they are moved through the network.
